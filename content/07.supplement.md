**Benchmark Data **
Panel A, depicts the performance of gender prediction for pipeline-identified quoted speakers. 
Panel B is a histogram of the number of articles that were falsely identified to mention a country by our processing pipeline. 
Panels C shows the estimated versus true frequency of country mentions within our benchmark dataset. The red line denotes the x = y line.

**Predicted male speakers are overrepresented in news quotes regardless of predicted journalist gender**
Panel A depicts two trend lines: Yellow: Proportion of _Nature_ news articles written by a predicted female journalist; Blue: Proportion of _Nature_ news articles written by a predicted male journalist.
We observe almost no gender difference in the number of articles written by male and female journalists.
Panel B depicts two trend lines: Yellow: Proportion of predicted male quotes in an article written by a predicted female journalist; Blue: Proportion of predicted male quotesin an article  written by a predicted male journalist.
In all plots, the colored bands represent the 5th and 95th bootstrap quantiles and the point is the mean calculated from 5,000 bootstrap samples.

**Predicted male speakers are overrepresented in news quotes when compared against _Springer Nature_ authorship**
Panel A depicts three trend lines: Purple: Proportion of _Nature_ quotes for an estimated male speaker; Light Grey: Proportion of _The Guardian_ quotes for an estimated male speaker; Yellow: Proportion of first author articles from an estimated male author in _Springer Nature_; Dark Mustard: Proportion of last author articles from an estimated male author in _Springer Nature_.
We observe a larger gender difference between first and last authors in _Springer Nature_ articles, however the proportion of predicted male speakers is less than observed in _Nature_ research articles.
Panel B depicts the proportion of male quotes broken down by article type.
In all plots the colored bands represent the 5th and 95th bootstrap quantiles and the point is the mean calculated from 5,000 bootstrap samples.

**Predicted Celtic/English, and European name origins are the highest cited, quoted, and mentioned**
Panel A, depicts the number of quotes, mentions, citations, or research articles considered in the name origin analysis.
Panels B-E depicts the proportion of a name origin in a given dataset, citations in articles written by journalists or writers, quoted speakers or mentions.
In all plots the colored bands represent the 5th and 95th bootstrap quantiles and the point is the mean calculated from 5,000 bootstrap samples.

**Over-representation of predicted Celtic/English and under-representation of East Asian name origins is also found in _Nature_ and _Springer Nature_ articles**
Panels A-F depicts ten plots, each for a possible name origin comparison against a background set.
Panel A, C, and E compare the citation (a), quote (c), or mention (e) rate against _Nature_ last author name origins.
Panel B, D, and F compare the citation (a), quote (c), or mention (e) rate against _Springer Nature_ last author name origins.
Panels A and B additionally partition the citation rates calculated into two sets, journalist-written articles (salmon) and scientist-written articles (mint green).
Only Panels C-F contain information from both _Nature_ and _The Guardian_, since no citations were extracted from _The Guardian_ articles.
For C-F, only journalist written articles are considered.

**Over-representation of predicted Celtic/English and under-representation of East Asian quotes and mentions are reduced when additionally considering citation**
Panels A-D depicts twelve plots, each for a possible name origin comparison against a background set.
Panels A and B compare name origin proportions of quotes from people that were also cited in the same article.
Panels C and D compare name origin proportions from mentions of people that were also cited in the same article.
In all plots the colored bands represent the 5th and 95th bootstrap quantiles and the point is the mean calculated from 5,000 bootstrap samples.

**Analysis of Country representation**
Panel A, depicts the citation rate for the top ten most cited articles by _Nature_ news.
Each plot is a comparison between the citation rate (yellow), _Nature_ author affiliation (grey), and _Springer Nature_ author affiliations (dark mustard).
Panel B depicts the top and bottom 5% of (mention rate - citation rate).
Each point represents a country - year pair.
Blue points are a country that is further considered to be a "Citation" or "Mention" country.
Panel C and D show the overall word frequencies of the 15 words with the largest ratio of frequencies between "Citation" (panel C) and "Mention" (panel D) countries.
