**Speakers predicted to be men are overrepresented in news quotes regardless of predicted journalist gender**
Panel a depicts two trend lines: Yellow: Proportion of _Nature_ news articles written by a predicted women journalist; Blue: Proportion of _Nature_ news articles written by a predicted men journalist.
We observe a moderate gender difference in the number of articles written by men and women journalists.
Panel b depicts two trend lines: Yellow: Proportion of quotes predicted to be from men in an article written by a journalist predicted to be a woman; Blue: Proportion of quotes predicted to be from men in an article written by a journalist predicted to be a man.
In all plots, the colored bands represent the 5th and 95th bootstrap quantiles and the point is the mean calculated from 1,000 bootstrap samples.

**Speakers predicted to be men  are overrepresented in news quotes when compared against _Springer Nature_ authorship**
Panel a depicts three trend lines: Purple: Proportion of _Nature_ quotes for a speaker estimated to be a man; Light Grey: Proportion of _The Guardian_ quotes for a speaker estimated to be a man; Yellow: Proportion of first author articles from an author estimated to be a man in _Springer Nature_; Dark Mustard: Proportion of last author articles from an author estimated to be a man  in _Springer Nature_.
We observe a larger gender difference between first and last authors in _Springer Nature_ articles, however the proportion of speakers estimated to be men is less than observed in _Nature_ research articles.
Panel b depicts the proportion of quotes from predicted men broken down by article type.
In all plots the colored bands represent the 5th and 95th bootstrap quantiles and the point is the mean calculated from 1,000 bootstrap samples.

**Predicted Celtic/English, and European name origins are the highest cited, quoted, and mentioned**
Panel a, depicts the number of quotes, mentions, citations, or research articles considered in the name origin analysis.
Panels b-g depicts the proportion of a name origin in a given dataset, citations in articles written by journalists or writers, quoted speakers or mentions.
In all plots the colored bands represent the 5th and 95th bootstrap quantiles and the point is the mean calculated from 1,000 bootstrap samples.

**Distribution of name origins _Nature_ and _Springer Nature_ articles**
Panels a-d depicts the predicted name origins of first and last authors in our background sets.
Panel a and b show the predicted name origins of _Nature_ first and last authors, respectively.
Panel c and d show the predicted name origins of _Springer Nature_ first and last authors, respectively.

**Over-representation of predicted Celtic/English and under-representation of East Asian name origins is also found in comparison to _Nature_ and _Springer Nature_ articles**
Panels a-f depicts ten plots, each for a possible name origin comparison against a background set.
Panel a, c, and e compare the citation (a), quote (c), or mention (e) rate against _Nature_ first and last author name origins.
Panel b, d, and f compare the citation (a), quote (c), or mention (e) rate against _Springer Nature_ first and last author name origins.
Panels a and b additionally partition the citation rates by journalist-written articles and scientist-written articles, each further divided into first or last author position.
For c-f, only journalist written articles are considered.

**Over-representation of predicted Celtic/English and under-representation of East Asian quotes and mentions are reduced when additionally considering citation**
Panels a-d depicts twelve plots, each for a possible name origin comparison against a background set.
Panels a and b compare name origin proportions of quotes from people that were also cited in the same article.
Panels c and d compare name origin proportions from mentions of people that were also cited in the same article.
In all plots the colored bands represent the 5th and 95th bootstrap quantiles and the point is the mean calculated from 1,000 bootstrap samples.

**Analysis of Country representation**
Panel A, depicts the citation rate for the top ten most cited articles by _Nature_ news.
Each plot is a comparison between the citation rate (yellow), _Nature_ author affiliation (grey), and _Springer Nature_ author affiliations (dark mustard).
Panel B depicts the top and bottom 5% of (mention rate - citation rate).
Each point represents a country - year pair.
Blue points are a country that is further considered to be a "Citation" or "Mention" country.
Panel C and D show the overall word frequencies of the 15 words with the largest ratio of frequencies between "Citation" (panel C) and "Mention" (panel D) countries.
