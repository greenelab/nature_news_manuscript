## Introduction
 
Science journalism is an indispensable part of scientific communication and provides an accessible way for everyone from researchers to the public to learn about new scientific findings and to consider their implications.
However, it is important to identify the ways in which its coverage may skew towards particular demographics. 
Coverage of science shapes who is considered a scientist and field expert by both peers and the public.
This indication of legitimacy can either help recognize people who are typically overlooked due to systemic biases or intensify biases.
Journalistic biases in general-interest, online and printed news have been observed by journalists themselves [@https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/enduring-whiteness-of-american-journalism; @https://medium.com/ladybits-on-medium/i-analyzed-a-year-of-my-reporting-for-gender-bias-and-this-is-what-i-found-a16c31e1cdf; @https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/gender-diversity-journalism/463023; @https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/i-spent-two-years-trying-to-fix-the-gender-imbalance-in-my-stories/552404], as well as by independent researchers [@doi:10.1177/0003122415596999; @doi:10.1080/1461670X.2013.834149; @doi:10.1177/0163443711418272; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0148434; @https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2013/lack-of-female-sources-in-new-york-times-stories-spotlights-need-for-change; @https://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp-2015-reports; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2004956].
Researchers found a gap between male and female subjects or sources, with independent studies finding that between 17-40% of total subjects were female across multiple general-interest printed news outlets between 1985 and 2015 [@doi:10.1177/0003122415596999; @doi:10.1080/1461670X.2013.834149; @https://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp-2015-reports].
One study found 27-35% of total subjects in international science and health related news were female between 1995 and 2015, and 46% in print, radio, and television in the United States in 2015 [@https://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp-2015-reports].
While gender disparities in news coverage have been extensively researched, our research is different because it focuses on science journalism and comparing it against the demographics of actively publishing scientists.
Additionally, our work focuses on research into disparities with respect to name origins, a focus which is currently lacking in the literature.

It should be noted that scientific news coverage is confounded by the existing differences in gender and racial demographics within the scientific field [@https://ncses.nsf.gov/wmpd; @doi:10.1038/s41590-019-0470-6].
However, we are interested in quantifying disparities with respect to observed demographic differences in the scientific field, using academic authorship as an estimate for the existing demographics. 
This is similar to other studies that have quantified gender or racial disparities in science as observed in citation [@doi:10.1177/2378023117738903; @doi:10.1038/504211a] and funding rates [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2021.01.011; @doi:10.1126/sciadv.aaz4868; @doi:10.1126/sciadv.aaw7238; @doi:10.1126/science.1165878; @doi:10.1126/science.1196783].

In researching a story, a journalist will typically interview multiple sources for their opinion, potentially asking for additional sources, thus allowing individual unconscious biases at any point along the interview chain to skew scientific coverage broadly.
In addition, the repeated selection of a small set of field experts or the approach a journalist takes in establishing a new source may intensify existing biases [@https://www.theopennotebook.com/2016/08/23/including-diverse-voices-in-science-stories; @https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/gender-diversity-journalism/463023; @https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/i-spent-two-years-trying-to-fix-the-gender-imbalance-in-my-stories/552404].
While disparities in representation may go unnoticed in a single article, analyzing a large corpus of articles can identify and quantify these disparities and help guide institutional and individual self-reflection.
In the same vein as previous media studies [@doi:10.1177/0003122415596999; @doi:10.1080/1461670X.2013.834149; @doi:10.1177/0163443711418272; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0148434; @https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2013/lack-of-female-sources-in-new-york-times-stories-spotlights-need-for-change; @https://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp-2015-reports], we sought to quantify gender and regional differences of journalism beyond the existing demographic differences in the scientific field.
Our study focused solely on science journalism, specifically content published by _Nature_.
Since _Nature_ also publishes primary research articles, we used these data to determine the demographics of the expected set of possible sources.
This is not a perfect comparator since journalists will not cover every story presented in the journal.
However, we assume that it is a reasonable baseline since large deviations could indicate a source of journalistic bias.
For clarity, throughout this manuscript we will refer to journalistic articles as _news_ and academic, primary research articles as _papers_. 
Furthermore, when we refer to "authors" we mean authors of academic papers, not journalists.
In our analysis, we identified quoted and cited people by analyzing the content and citations within all news articles from 2005 to 2020, and compared this demographic to the academic publishing demographic by analyzing first and last authorship statistics across all _Nature_ papers during the same time period.
 
Through our analysis of 22,001 news articles, we were able to identify >88,000 quotes and >15,000 citations with sufficient speaker or author information. <!-- check citation number -->
We also identified first and last authors of >10,000 _Nature_ papers.
We then identified possible gender or regional differences using the extracted names.
The extracted names were used to generate three data-types: quoted, mentioned, and cited people.
We used computational methods to predict gender and identified a trend towards quotes from people predicted male in news articles when compared to both the general population and predicted male authorship in papers.
Within the period that we examined, the proportion of predicted male attributed quotes in news articles went from initially higher to currently lower than the proportion of male first and last authors in _Nature_ papers.
Furthermore, we found that the quote difference was dependent on article type; the “Career Feature” column achieved gender parity in quoted speakers.

We also used computational methods to predict name origins of quoted, mentioned, and cited people.
Through our analysis, we found a significant over-representation of names with predicted Celtic/English origin and under-representation of names with a predicted East Asian origin in both quotes and mentions.
To our knowledge, our work is the first to identify a substantial under-representation of names with a predicted East Asian origin in scientific journalism.
 
While we focused on news from _Nature_, our software can be repurposed to analyze other text.
We hope that publishers will welcome systems to identify disparities and use them to improve representation in journalism.
Furthermore, our approach is limited by the features we were able to extract, which only reflects a portion of the journalistic process.
Journalists could additionally track all sources they contact to self-audit.
However, auditing is only part of the solution; journalists and source recommenders must also change their source gathering patterns.
To help change these patterns, there exist guides [@https://www.theopennotebook.com/2016/08/23/including-diverse-voices-in-science-stories], databases [@https://gage.500womenscientists.org, @https://www.womensmediacenter.com/shesource], and affinity groups that can help us all expand our vision of who can be considered a field expert.
